Problems and solution to Algorithmic Problems


1. Roman Numeral to Decimal and reverse algorithm

Using modified cashier algorithm to convert decimal to Roman Numeral and vice versa. Cashier's algorithm ensures optimality of the alogrithm and makes it easy to expand to other uses.

2. Multiple armed Bandit problem

Testing basic method to see performance. Also a new algorithm that may be used for online application with different time of introduction basic on statistics and reisk factor to minimize regret.
